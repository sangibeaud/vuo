Nodes for working with data in ways that are independent of data type (such as storing the most recent data) or that apply to most data types (such as checking if two values are the same).

The [Hold Value](vuo-node://vuo.data.hold2) and [Hold List](vuo-node://vuo.data.hold.list2) nodes can be used within a feedback loop to do something repeatedly or iteratively. For more information, see the [Vuo Manual](https://doc.vuo.org/latest/manual/how-events-travel-through-a-composition.xhtml#feedback-loops).
