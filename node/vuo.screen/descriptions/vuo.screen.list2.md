Gives a list of all available screens.

This node fires an event with an updated list of screens whenever it sees a change in the screens available â€” specifically, when the composition starts or this node is added to a running composition, or when a new screen is attached or detached.

If display mirroring is enabled (System Settings > Displays > Arrangement > Mirror Displays), this node only outputs one screen (since all mirrored screens are treated identically).
