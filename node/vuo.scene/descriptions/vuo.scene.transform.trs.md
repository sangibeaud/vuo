Applies a transformation to a 3D object.

   - `Object` — The original 3D object.
   - `Translation` — The amount to move the object, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Rotation` —  The amount to rotate the object, in degrees (Euler angles).
   - `Scale` — The amount to scale the object.

Unlike the [Combine 3D Objects](vuo-node://vuo.scene.combine) nodes, this node doesn't put the 3D object in a group.
