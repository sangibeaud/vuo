Preserves a circle in an image.  Outside that circle, streaks the edge pixels outward.

   - `Center` — The middle of the circular area, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Radius` — The size of the circular area, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Twirl Angle` — The amount to rotate the stretched pixels, in degrees.
   - `Fade` — The amount to fade out the stretched pixels — at 1, the stretched pixels are fully transparent.
   - `Fade Sharpness` — How sharp the transition into the fade is.  A value of 0 means the transition is very gradual; a value of 1 means the transition is immediate.
