   - `X Range`, `Y Range`, `Z Range` — The first and last positions to output.
   - `X Curve`, `X Easing`, `Y Curve`, `Y Easing`, `Z Curve`, `Z Easing` — The shape of the [easing curve](vuo-nodeset://vuo.motion) that defines how the points are spaced.
   - `X Point Count`, `Y Point Count`, `Z Point Count` — How many points to create along each axis.

Thanks to [Martinus Magneson](https://vuo.org/user/3272) for developing the node this is based on.
