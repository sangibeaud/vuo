Nodes for working with events, which control the timing of when different parts of a composition execute.

**Events** are a fundamental concept in Vuo. They're what make things happen in a composition. For more information, see the [Vuo Manual](https://doc.vuo.org/latest/manual/how-events-and-data-travel-through-a-composition.xhtml).

Some of these nodes fire events in response to certain basic activity as a composition is running, such as when the composition first starts or when the display refreshes.

To fire events at certain time intervals, see the [vuo.time](vuo-nodeset://vuo.time) node set. 

Many other node sets also have nodes that fire events (for example, in response to activity from a device).
