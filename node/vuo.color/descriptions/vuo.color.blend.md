Blends two colors into a single color. 

   - `Background` — The background color (bottom layer) to blend.
   - `Foreground` — The foreground color (top layer) to blend.
   - `Blend Mode` — The way that the colors should be blended. For information about blend modes, see: 
      - [Wikipedia article on blend modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes)
      - [Photoshop blend modes](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/blending-modes.html)
      - [GIMP blend modes](http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-layer-modes.html)
   - `Foreground Opacity` — The opacity that the foreground color should have in the blended color, ranging from 0 to 1.
